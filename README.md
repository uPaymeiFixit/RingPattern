# canvas-rings-pattern
HTML5 / JavaScript Practice

An early project created to practice JavaScript and HTML. Uses HTML5 canvas to animate colored rings. 

Ring start and end positions are calculated by passing a linearly increasing value into sine and cosine functions. Draw direction swaps if two ends meet, but are rounded in such a way to create a sort of bouncing / flickering effect.
